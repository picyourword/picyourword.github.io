Hack The North 2021

Inspiration: In the midst of a global pandemic, where members of society are confined to their homes for the safety of others, creativity can be limited and individuals cannot express themselves as easily. The countless months in isolation may have dimmed the creative spirit for many individuals, but with PicYourWord all it takes is a single word to curate a personalized mood board to boost personal morale. They say a picture is worth 1000 words, but in this case a single word has the power to spark a unique collection of pictures to express your mood.

Solution: A web application that allows users to create a custom mood board from one word. This embodies how many people may interpret something differently and each mood board curated can be unique to the user who prompted its creation. Users have the option to create an account to save their moodboards for future viewing.

The Team: While in a virtual environment, Hack The North 2021 brought together 4 very bright and likeminded women from across Ontario to collaborate and bring this idea to life. Being able to work with the team and interact with new online softwares and platforms brought about new skills and learning opportunities for each member. With varying levels of experience throughout the team it was a chance to learn together and develop a useful webpage that we hope can bring light into someone's life with just one word.
